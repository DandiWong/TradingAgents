      "indicators_description": "Categories and each category's indicators are:\n\nMoving Averages:\n- close_50_sma: 50 SMA: A medium-term trend indicator. Usage: Identify trend direction and serve as dynamic support/resistance. Tips: It lags price; combine with faster indicators for timely signals.\n- close_200_sma: 200 SMA: A long-term trend benchmark. Usage: Confirm overall market trend and identify golden/death cross setups. Tips: It reacts slowly; best for strategic trend confirmation rather than frequent trading entries.\n- close_10_ema: 10 EMA: A responsive short-term average. Usage: Capture quick shifts in momentum and potential entry points. Tips: Prone to noise in choppy markets; use alongside longer averages for filtering false signals.\n\nMACD Related:\n- macd: MACD: Computes momentum via differences of EMAs. Usage: Look for crossovers and divergence as signals of trend changes. Tips: Confirm with other indicators in low-volatility or sideways markets.\n- macds: MACD Signal: An EMA smoothing of the MACD line. Usage: Use crossovers with the MACD line to trigger trades. Tips: Should be part of a broader strategy to avoid false positives.\n- macdh: MACD Histogram: Shows the gap between the MACD line and its signal. Usage: Visualize momentum strength and spot divergence early. Tips: Can be volatile; complement with additional filters in fast-moving markets.\n\nMomentum Indicators:\n- rsi: RSI: Measures momentum to flag overbought/oversold conditions. Usage: Apply 70/30 thresholds and watch for divergence to signal reversals. Tips: In strong trends, RSI may remain extreme; always cross-check with trend analysis.\n\nVolatility Indicators:\n- boll: Bollinger Middle: A 20 SMA serving as the basis for Bollinger Bands. Usage: Acts as a dynamic benchmark for price movement. Tips: Combine with the upper and lower bands to effectively spot breakouts or reversals.\n- boll_ub: Bollinger Upper Band: Typically 2 standard deviations above the middle line. Usage: Signals potential overbought conditions and breakout zones. Tips: Confirm signals with other tools; prices may ride the band in strong trends.\n- boll_lb: Bollinger Lower Band: Typically 2 standard deviations below the middle line. Usage: Indicates potential oversold conditions. Tips: Use additional analysis to avoid false reversal signals.\n- atr: ATR: Averages true range to measure volatility. Usage: Set stop-loss levels and adjust position sizes based on current market volatility. Tips: It's a reactive measure, so use it as part of a broader risk management strategy.\n\nVolume-Based Indicators:\n- vwma: VWMA: A moving average weighted by volume. Usage: Confirm trends by integrating price action with volume data. Tips: Watch for skewed results from volume spikes; use in combination with other volume analyses.",
